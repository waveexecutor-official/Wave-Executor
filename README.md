# Wave-Executor
Wave is an innovative Windows executor developed by the talented SPDM Team and CodeX engineers. It includes numerous cutting-edge technologies such as AI, a built-in script hub, HDWID spoofing, and enhanced scripting capabilities. Additionally, Wave boasts a 100% stealth mode Byfron bypass, preventing your account from being banned.

Wave Executor Premium offers advanced features like a decompiler and save instance functionality. It also includes an AI component, making it easier to find and use free Roblox scripts. Unlike the free version of Wave, the commercial edition is ad-free and has a direct download link. Wave Premium provides multi-instance, multi-inject, and 100% UNC support. It is more affordable than other Windows executors and doesn't require keys.

Designed for Windows and PC users, Wave supports all Roblox scripts and is easy to use. While the paid version offers additional features, the free edition remains highly effective. The ability to run and execute scripts in popular Roblox games like Blox Fruits, Pet Simulator X, Da Hood, Shindo Life, Combat Warriors, Doors, My Restaurant, MM2, and others is a key reason why Wave is sought after by Roblox enthusiasts.

Wave Executor's straightforward and user-friendly interface quickly made it popular among Roblox fans. Before Wave Executor's release, Roblox users struggled to execute and run scripts in PC and Windows games like Blox Fruits and Pet Simulator X. The introduction of Wave Executor was groundbreaking for Roblox players.
